# PythonQuiz
My first full coding project, a quiz application made in Python. This is where I put what I learned about basic programming concepts 
(conditionals, arrays, functions, iterative statements etc) into practice. 

FEATURES: 

-Takes user's name and the number of questions they want to answer (maximum is the number of questions in the list).

-Random question selection from a list of dictionaries. 

-Selected questions are removed from the list and stored in another. When the quiz ends, all used questions are re-appended.

-Round counting system, tracks how many times the quiz has been replayed. 

-Scoreboard system, shows usernames and their percentage of correct answers. Shows average score of all participants. 

-Airtight input validation system.
